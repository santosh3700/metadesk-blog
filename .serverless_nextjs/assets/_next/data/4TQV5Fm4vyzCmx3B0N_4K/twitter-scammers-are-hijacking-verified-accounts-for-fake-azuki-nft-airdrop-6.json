After all, the other three Bitcoin futures ETFs have all slid in price since their debut. But this new fund is different.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">The other three funds were approved under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which the SEC has said provides strong consumer protections. But the Teucrium ETF marks the first time the SEC has approved a Bitcoin futures fund under the Securities Act of 1933.</p>\n<div class=\"sc-95e1c46c-6 jzgamX adbutler-inline-ad\">\n<div class=\"sc-f7e9988f-0 sc-95e1c46c-7 gbYvgh cqYHZJ\">\n<div class=\"sc-6d5af9f4-0 hKRlV\">\n<h3 class=\"sc-e93b592e-3 sc-95e1c46c-5 KNgtG ctitRD\">Get The Decrypt App</h3>\n</div>\n<p><span class=\"sc-4625f44d-1 esSKfH sc-95e1c46c-9 gSlvRV\">For the best experience, top crypto news at your fingertips and exclusive features download now.</span></p>\n<div class=\"flex\"><a class=\"sc-adb616fe-0 ePvUAp\" title=\"app-store-link\" href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1508494821\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"sc-d06f0708-0 hDQQlZ\" src=\"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/200/wp-content/themes/decrypt-media/assets/images/illustrations/apple-app-store-button.png\" /></a> <a class=\"sc-adb616fe-0 ePvUAp\" title=\"app-store-link\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.decrypt.app\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"sc-d06f0708-0 hDQQlZ\" src=\"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/200/wp-content/themes/decrypt-media/assets/images/illustrations/google-play-button.png\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">The SEC said last summer in an investor bulletin that funds regulated under the 1940 act provide “important investor protections,”—rules regarding valuation, liquidity, and custody of fund assets—that aren’t covered under the 1933 act.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">For example, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF that was denied last week was filed under the 1933 act.

font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">The significance hasn’t been lost on Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein, who’s been suggesting that his firm may file a lawsuit against the SEC to get its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) converted into a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">He said in a Twitter thread yesterday evening that the SEC “can no longer justifiably cite the ‘40 Act as being the differentiating factor&#8221; between futures and spot ETF approvals.</p>\n<div

One journalist, who spoke to <i>Decrypt</i> under the condition of anonymity, said that their account had sent out more than 6,000 tweets, with nearly all of them tagging several potential victims for the scheme.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">The Azuki-themed scam is very similar in approach to a recent one surrounding ApeCoin (APE), the Ethereum-based token created for the budding <span class=\"sc-917aed08-1 fYyPhF\"><span class=\"sc-48a5c6a5-1 dTCiDE\"><span class=\"sc-48a5c6a5-4 eylCNa\">Web3</span></span></span> ecosystem that’s being built around Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT project.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">In March, more than $1 million worth of NFTs were reportedly stolen from collectors who interacted with a Twitter scam, which promised to airdrop a bounty of ApeCoin tokens to users. However, when someone connected a wallet, the scammers likewise stole NFTs that were within the wallet—including Bored Ape and Mutant Ape Yacht Club collectibles, in some cases.</p>\n<div class=\"my-4 sm:my-8 bg-decryptBackgroundColor border-t border-b border-decryptGridline post-content-w-full \">\n<article class=\"flex md:grid md:grid-cols-8 md:gap-4 p-5\">\n<div class=\"md:col-span-3 shrink-0 w-22 md:w-auto mr-3 md:mr-0\">\n<div class=\"h-28 md:h-40 relative overflow-hidden transition duration-200 transform hover:-translate-y-0.5 hover:shadow-lg\">\n<p><img class=\"object-cover absolute inset-0 box-border p-0 border-0 m-auto block w-0 h-0 min-w-full max-w-full min-h-full max-h-full\" src=\"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1536/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apecoin-bored-ape-yacht-club-gID_1.png.webp\" sizes=\"256px\" srcset=\"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/16/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apecoin-bored-ape-yacht-club-gID_1.png.webp 16w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/32/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apecoin-bored-ape-yacht-club-gID_1.png.webp 32w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/48/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apecoin-bored-ape-yacht-club-gID_1.png.webp 48w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/64/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apecoin-bored-ape-yacht-club-gID_1.png.webp 64w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/96/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apecoin-bored-ape-yacht-club-gID_1.png.webp 96w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/128/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apecoin-bored-ape-yacht-club-gID_1.png.webp 128w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/256/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apecoin-bored-ape-yacht-club-gID_1.png.webp 256w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/384/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apecoin-bored-ape-yacht-club-gID_1.png.webp 384w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/600/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apecoin-bored-ape-yacht-club-gID_1.png.webp 600w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/640/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apecoin-bored-ape-yacht-club-gID_1.png.webp 640w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/768/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apecoin-bored-ape-yacht-club-gID_1.png.webp 768w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/950/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apecoin-bored-ape-yacht-club-gID_1.png.webp 950w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apecoin-bored-ape-yacht-club-gID_1.png.webp 1024w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1200/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apecoin-bored-ape-yacht-club-gID_1.png.webp 1200w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1280/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apecoin-bored-ape-yacht-club-gID_1.png.webp 1280w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1536/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/apecoin-bored-ape-yacht-club-gID_1.png.webp 1536w\" alt=\"ApeCoin (APE), the Ethereum token based on the Bored Ape Yacht Club.

Curiously, some of the ApeCoin scam victims claimed that they did <i>not</i> connect their wallet at the listed website, yet still said that their NFTs were stolen.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">By using stolen verified Twitter accounts, the scammers have been able to convince some NFT collectors to interact with their scheme. In some cases, people have responded to the tweets openly asking why Twitter would verify a scammer, but it’s the other way around: a scammer had stolen a verified account to give the appearance of being reputable.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">In both cases, it should be made clear that the real creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club and Azuki NFT projects are not behind these scams. ApeCoin was only <span class=\"sc-917aed08-1 fYyPhF\"><span class=\"sc-48a5c6a5-1 dTCiDE\"><span class=\"sc-48a5c6a5-4 eylCNa\">airdropped</span></span></span>—or sent to NFT holders’ wallets—to existing Bored Ape holders, while Beans have only been airdropped to Azuki NFT holders.

Popular NFT use cases include profile pictures (like Azuki), sports collectibles, interactive video game items, and more.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">The extent of the overall damage from the Azuki scam is currently unclear. The journalist that <i>Decrypt</i> spoke to said that once they recovered their Twitter account, they received numerous direct messages from people who had been scammed and were requesting their stolen NFTs back. The journalist no longer had the DMs to share with <i>Decrypt</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">One of the media professionals most recently affected by the scam was Emily Buder, head of video at Quanta Magazine, whose account was apparently hijacked today. As the screenshot above shows, her profile kept her real name intact, but listed her as a co-creator of Azuki, as well as a former artist for the video game Overwatch.</p>\n<figure class=\"w-full max-w-full mt-4 overflow-hidden\"><img class=\"object-contain absolute inset-0 box-border p-0 border-0 m-auto block w-0 h-0 min-w-full max-w-full min-h-full max-h-full\" src=\"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1536/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/azuki-nft-twitter-scam-profile.png.webp\" sizes=\"(min-width: 640px) 950px, 384px\" srcset=\"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/16/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/azuki-nft-twitter-scam-profile.png.webp 16w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/32/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/azuki-nft-twitter-scam-profile.png.webp 32w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/48/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/azuki-nft-twitter-scam-profile.png.webp 48w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/64/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/azuki-nft-twitter-scam-profile.png.webp 64w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/96/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/azuki-nft-twitter-scam-profile.png.webp 96w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/128/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/azuki-nft-twitter-scam-profile.png.webp 128w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/256/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/azuki-nft-twitter-scam-profile.png.webp 256w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/384/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/azuki-nft-twitter-scam-profile.png.webp 384w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/600/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/azuki-nft-twitter-scam-profile.png.webp 600w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/640/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/azuki-nft-twitter-scam-profile.png.webp 640w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/768/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/azuki-nft-twitter-scam-profile.png.webp 768w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/950/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/azuki-nft-twitter-scam-profile.png.webp 950w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/azuki-nft-twitter-scam-profile.png.webp 1024w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1200/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/azuki-nft-twitter-scam-profile.png.webp 1200w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1280/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/azuki-nft-twitter-scam-profile.png.webp 1280w, https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1536/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/azuki-nft-twitter-scam-profile.png.webp 1536w\" alt=\"\" data-nimg=\"responsive\" /><figcaption class=\"m-0 text-left\">This account was hijacked and made to look like that of an Azuki co-creator.

A Twitter representative confirmed that the company is &#8220;aware of and actively working on a solution to combat&#8221; these scams.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">Azuki is one of the most popular new NFT projects to launch so far in 2022, generating about $563 million worth of secondary market trading volume since its January launch, per data from CryptoSlam. A single Azuki NFT sold for a record $1.42 million last week.

But its tokenomic structure is unique; LUNA works in tandem with Terra&#8217; algorithmic stablecoins. Whenever someone wants to mint TerraUSD (UST), they must burn the equivalent value of LUNA—and vice versa. This means that if the price of the stablecoin slips, people can buy it for below its value but still exchange it for LUNA at the pegged rate.</p>\n<div class=\"border-b border-t border-neutral-200\">\n<article class=\"p-5\">\n<div class=\"mb-4\">\n<div class=\"w-full \">\n<div id=\"decrypt-player-UdF1GFmE\" class=\"jwplayer jw-reset jw-state-idle jw-stretch-uniform jw-flag-aspect-mode jw-skin-decrypt-player jw-breakpoint-2 jw-floating-dismissible jw-flag-user-inactive\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"application\" aria-label=\"Video Player\" aria-describedby=\"jw-shortcuts-tooltip-explanation\">\n<div class=\"jw-wrapper jw-reset\">\n<div class=\"jw-controls jw-reset\">\n<div class=\"jw-nextup-container jw-reset\">\n<div class=\"jw-nextup jw-background-color jw-reset jw-nextup-thumbnail-visible\">\n<div class=\"jw-nextup-tooltip jw-reset\">\n<div class=\"jw-nextup-thumbnail jw-reset\"><span style=\"font-size: 48px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: -0.0415625em;\">Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Top 3 Blockchains to Watch in 2022</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p class=\"text-neutral-900 mb-3 font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-sm md:text-base leading-4.5 md:leading-5 tracking-tightest line-clamp-2 md:line-clamp-3\">On the first episode of Decrypt&#8217;s gm podcast, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried revealed his picks for the three most promising blockchains in 2022.

Currently, the company&#8217;s reach is much smaller than the likes of PayPal and few consumers have heard of it, though Kuruvilla points out this is because Bolt uses a &#8220;while label&#8221; model that lets merchants use their own brands at the point of payment.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">According to Bolt founder Ryan Breslow, the Wyre acquisition is something of a full-circle moment for Bolt since crypto was part of its plans when it launched eight years ago, though the company dropped those plans in the face of challenging business conditions.</p>\n<div class=\"my-4 border-b border-decryptGridline\">\n<div class=\"sc-7320e5d8-0 izdLHX\">\n<div class=\"sc-7320e5d8-1

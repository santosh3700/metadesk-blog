As the name suggests, a reference rate is price data for an asset. But having that data available is an important prerequisite for offering products like ETFs and futures contracts.</p>\n<div class=\"sc-95e1c46c-6 jzgamX adbutler-inline-ad\">\n<div class=\"sc-f7e9988f-0 sc-95e1c46c-7 gbYvgh ffDkIG\">\n<div class=\"sc-6d5af9f4-0 hKRlV\">\n<div class=\"sc-e9e015-0 cAIQRm\"></div>\n<h3 class=\"sc-e93b592e-3 sc-95e1c46c-5 KNgtG ctitRD\">Listen to The Decrypt Daily Podcast</h3>\n</div>\n<p><span class=\"sc-4625f44d-1 esSKfH sc-95e1c46c-9 gSlvRV\">Your daily dose of cryptocurrency news, learning, gossip, and discussions.</span><button class=\"sc-61c70920-0 eXtrxZ sc-95e1c46c-8 eyZYCC\"> Listen</button></p>\n<div class=\"sc-a350111e-0 gTEdbZ\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">At launch, price data for the indices will be provided by Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, itBit, and Kraken.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">“These new benchmarks, which capture 90% of the total investable cryptocurrency market cap today, are designed to allow traders, institutions and other users to confidently and more accurately manage cryptocurrency price risk, price portfolios or create structured products like ETFs,” said Tim McCourt, CME’s head of equity and FX products, in a press release.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">ETFs, or exchange traded funds, bundle together assets and sell shares to investors. It’s a way to get exposure to the underlying assets without owning them directly. Futures contracts speculate on the price of an asset, which can be anything from a stock, commodity or, in this case, a cryptocurrency.</p>\n<h4 class=\"sc-e93b592e-4 cXcZBp\"><iframe class=\"-mb-8

reason to believe CME won’t wait long to increase its crypto product offerings.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">Payal Shah, CME’s director of equity and cryptocurrency products, said last week that the group is “<a class=\"sc-adb616fe-0 ePvUAp\" href=\"https://decrypt.co/96722/cme-group-looking-at-offering-solana-cardano-futures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">looking at</a>” offering futures contracts for Cardano and Solana.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">Right now, CME offers Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, as well as futures contracts for micro Bitcoin and micro Ethereum, which can be purchased in denominations one-tenth the size of one BTC or ETH.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">And those futures contracts have done remarkably well for CME.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">Micro Bitcoin futures, which launched last May, have already generated almost 5 million contracts, said Shah.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">“In the few years—just over four years—since we launched our initial futures contract, the standard Bitcoin future with five-time multiplier, we’ve seen that grow from doing 1,000 contracts a day to now 10,000 a day,” she said. “That growth is mind-boggling.”</p>\n<div class=\"bg-white w-full p-4 flex flex-col\">\n<div class=\"relative flex flex-col items-start w-full

a press release. “We’ve very excited to see the CME CF index family expanding to lay the foundation for new, innovative ETFs in this highly coveted asset class.”</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro

Once the reference rates are available, Evolve could potentially create ETFs to give investors exposure to altcoins.</p>\n</div>\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Chainalysis Adds ‘Internet of

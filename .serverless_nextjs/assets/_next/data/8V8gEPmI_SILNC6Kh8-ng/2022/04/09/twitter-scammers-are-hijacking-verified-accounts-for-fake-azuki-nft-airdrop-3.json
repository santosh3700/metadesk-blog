Users can buy or sell seven different assets on the platform—Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Litecoin. Coinbase, meanwhile, is strictly a crypto firm, listing 170 coins and tokens, according to data from CoinMarketCap.</p>\n<div class=\"border-b border-t border-neutral-200\">\n<article class=\"p-5\">\n<div class=\"mb-4\">\n<div class=\"w-full \">\n<div id=\"decrypt-player-8cZI3asH\" class=\"jwplayer jw-reset jw-state-idle jw-stretch-uniform jw-flag-aspect-mode jw-skin-decrypt-player jw-breakpoint-2 jw-floating-dismissible jw-flag-user-inactive\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"application\" aria-label=\"Video Player\" aria-describedby=\"jw-shortcuts-tooltip-explanation\">\n<div class=\"jw-wrapper jw-reset\">\n<div class=\"jw-controls jw-reset\">\n<div class=\"jw-nextup-container jw-reset\">\n<div class=\"jw-nextup jw-background-color jw-reset jw-nextup-thumbnail-visible\">\n<div class=\"jw-nextup-tooltip jw-reset\">\n<div class=\"jw-nextup-body jw-reset\">\n<div class=\"jw-nextup-duration jw-reset\"><a class=\"block \" style=\"font-size: 48px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: -0.0415625em;\" href=\"https://decrypt.co/videos/interviews/8cZI3asH/robinhood-crypto-coo-talks-shib-defi-and-wallets-at-crypto-goes-mainstream\">Robinhood Crypto COO Talks SHIB, DeFi, and Wallets at Crypto Goes Mainstream</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p class=\"text-neutral-900 mb-3 font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-sm md:text-base leading-4.5 md:leading-5 tracking-tightest line-clamp-2 md:line-clamp-3\">Decrypt and Yahoo Finance present: Crypto Goes Mainstream, an afternoon of live conversations with some of the biggest names in crypto to talk investing, mass adoption, NFT collecting, and how to get started with Web 3.

During Q1 of 2022, by contrast, price movements were more subdued, generally operating in a band between $35,000 and $45,000.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">Coinbase posted record revenue of $2.5 billion for Q4, alongside near-record profits. While it also reported trading volume of $547 billion, Goldman predicts that will slip to $302 billion for Q1. Coinbase declined to comment on the matter to <i>Decrypt</i>, but also noted in its Q4 earnings call that it expected Q1 volumes to decline somewhat.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">Robinhood, meanwhile, doesn&#8217;t have a great Q4 to point to. Its $363 million in total revenue and $48 million in crypto revenue were up on a year-to-year basis, but below Q2 and Q3 figures. And Nance says the firm has a &#8220;limited path to near term profitability&#8221; moving forward. Robinhood declined to comment.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">The trading platform has been trying to increase traction for its crypto offerings. On Thursday, it announced that users on the waitlist for its long-anticipated crypto wallet could begin using the feature to transfer their holdings off the app.</p>\n<div class=\"my-4 sm:my-8 bg-decryptBackgroundColor border-t border-b border-decryptGridline post-content-w-full \">\n<article class=\"flex md:grid md:grid-cols-8 md:gap-4 p-5\">\n<div class=\"md:col-span-3 shrink-0 w-22 md:w-auto mr-3 md:mr-0\">\n<div class=\"h-28 md:h-40 relative overflow-hidden transition duration-200 transform hover:-translate-y-0.5 hover:shadow-lg\">\n<div class=\"post-decoration hidden md:block\">\n<div class=\"sc-f475625f-0 eQDYGC previewLabel\">\n<div class=\"sc-6d5af9f4-0 hKRlV\"><button class=\"sc-61c70920-0 inRAKC sc-192c0c11-0 gMTtqD sc-f475625f-1 kmxEpL\">Bitcoin</button></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"grow md:col-span-5\">\n<h2 class=\"mb-2 font-ak-bold text-base md:text-xl leading-4.5 md:leading-5.5 text-neutral-900 dark:text-primary-200\">Robinhood to Use Lightning Network for Bitcoin Transactions</h2>\n<p class=\"mb-3 font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-sm md:text-base leading-4.5 md:leading-5 tracking-tightest text-neutral-900 dark:text-primary-100 line-clamp-2 md:line-clamp-3\">Stock and cryptocurrency trading app Robinhood announced at the Bitcoin 2022 conference today that it’s making plans to add the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its platform for speedier BTC trans&#8230;</p>\n<footer>\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center mb-1\">\n<div class=\"mb-1 mr-auto\">\n<div class=\"flex items-center\"><span class=\"text-xs md:text-sm leading-none md:leading-none hover:underline hover:cursor-pointer font-ak-bold text-neutral-900 dark:text-primary-300 capitalize\">News</span><span class=\"text-xs md:text-sm leading-none md:leading-none hover:underline hover:cursor-pointer font-ak-bold text-neutral-900 dark:text-primary-300 capitalize\">Technology</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mb-1 flex items-center\"><span class=\"font-ak-regular font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-neutral-700 dark:text-primary-100 leading-3 md:leading-4\">2 min read</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"flex items-center\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center mr-auto\"><span class=\"font-ak-regular font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-neutral-700 dark:text-primary-100 leading-3 md:leading-4\">Kate Irwin</span><span class=\"font-ak-regular font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-neutral-700 dark:text-primary-100 leading-3 md:leading-4 whitespace-nowrap\"><time datetime=\"2022-04-07T17:31:02Z\">Apr 7, 2022</time></span></div>\n<div class=\"flex items-center\">\n<div class=\"relative inline-flex\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</footer>\n</div>\n</article>\n</div>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">At the same time, Robinhood announced that it will be integrating Lightning Network for Bitcoin transactions.

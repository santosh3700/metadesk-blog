For example, it’s unclear exactly how open and interoperable Facebook’s metaverse will be.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">M² is apparently built with interoperability in mind. The initiative combines Improbable’s Morpheus gaming technology—which reportedly enables richly detailed online worlds with more than 10,000 live users—with new Web3 tools and tech.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">It’s designed to bring metaverse worlds to life, but is built to work with “existing worlds as well as new projects,” per a release. The embedded trailer below shows an example of the technology at work, with well over 1,000 players all interacting together in a shared game world.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">Exactly how M² plans to bridge across metaverse worlds remains to be seen, however. Improbable CEO and co-founder Herman Narula described current blockchain bridges to <i>Bloomberg</i> as “a fairly crude solution,” and said it would release a whitepaper regarding its cybersecurity plans.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">Cross-chain bridges have been a growing target for attacks in recent months. Late last month, the bridge that connects play-to-earn game Axie Infinity’s Ronin <span class=\"sc-917aed08-1 fYyPhF\"><span class=\"sc-48a5c6a5-1 dTCiDE\"><span class=\"sc-48a5c6a5-4 eylCNa\">sidechain</span></span></span> to the Ethereum <span class=\"sc-917aed08-1 fYyPhF\"><span class=\"sc-48a5c6a5-1 dTCiDE\"><span class=\"sc-48a5c6a5-4 eylCNa\">mainnet</span></span></span> was exploited for $622 million worth of cryptocurrency. In February, the Wormhole bridge between Ethereum and Solana was hacked for $320 million.</p>\n<article class=\"pt-8 pb-10 px-5 md:px-[4.625rem] text-center bg-neutral-50 border-y border-neutral-200 adbutler-inline-ad my-4\">\n<h3 class=\"mb-4 font-ak-bold text-lg leading-none text-neutral-800\">The best of Decrypt straight to your inbox.</h3>\n<div class=\"flex flex-col my-6\">\n<div class=\"w-full h-40 mt-6 order-last relative shrink-0\">\n<div class=\"w-full h-40\"><img class=\"object-cover absolute inset-0 box-border p-0 border-0 m-auto block w-0 h-0 min-w-full max-w-full min-h-full max-h-full\" src=\"https://decrypt.co/a/img/?libBID=3353457\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://decrypt.co/a/img/?libBID=3353457 600w, https://decrypt.co/a/img/?libBID=3353457 640w, https://decrypt.co/a/img/?libBID=3353457 768w, https://decrypt.co/a/img/?libBID=3353457 950w, https://decrypt.co/a/img/?libBID=3353457 1024w, https://decrypt.co/a/img/?libBID=3353457 1200w, https://decrypt.co/a/img/?libBID=3353457 1280w, https://decrypt.co/a/img/?libBID=3353457 1536w\" alt=\"decrypt-email\" data-nimg=\"fill\" /></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"grow font-ak-regular text-base leading-5 text-neutral-800\">Get the top stories curated daily, weekly roundups &amp; deep dives straight to your inbox.</div>\n</div>\n<form class=\"flex flex-col\"><input class=\"text-neutral-900 border-black w-full mb-2 p-2 font-ak-regular text-base leading-6 border-2 rounded-md shadow-sm\" name=\"email\" required=\"\" type=\"email\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Your Email\" /><button class=\"w-full py-2.5 px-4 font-ak-regular text-base leading-6 bg-black hover:bg-neutral-800 active:bg-black disabled:bg-neutral-700 disabled:hover:bg-neutral-700 disabled:active:bg-neutral-700 disabled:border disabled:border-neutral-300 text-white rounded-md inline-flex active:ring-2 active:ring-violet-600 active:ring-offset-1 whitespace-nowrap\" type=\"submit\"><span class=\"w-full text-center\">Join Now</span></button></form>\n</article>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">According to <i>Bloomberg</i>, M² investors will eventually receive crypto tokens as a result of the funding, but it won’t represent a collective majority of the supply. Narula told the publication that it intends to let the community of users govern the coming platform, in a nod towards progressive decentralization.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">Andreessen and Softbank each previously led a round of funding for Improbable—the main entity, not this new M² initiative—which was valued at about $2 billion in 2017 after a $502 million Series B round.</p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">Following that funding, Improbable struggled to execute on its SpatialOS gaming infrastructure, and saw multiple games shut down after launching with it. Narula admitted to <i>Bloomberg</i> that its earlier technology was “​​more challenging to operate than it needed to be.”</p>\n</div>\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Chainalysis Adds ‘Internet
